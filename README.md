# MSc-Coursework-RiskAnalysis

Enclosed script returns the VaR of a derivative portfolio
Uses Monte-Carlo simulation and greeks up to the second order (delta, gamma and theta) to estimate the portfolio risk (VaR) and estimates this under exact, linear, quadratic and full revaluation methods.
Commented out are methods for returning density plots related to the VaR for all of the portfolios.
